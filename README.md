Knows about workdays and holidays, public and otherwise.
Answers the age-old question _When is Mother's Day this year?_.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kytrinyx/timetress.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/kytrinyx/timetress)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
gem 'timetress'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install timetress
```

## Usage

### Timetress knows about holidays

```ruby
Timetress.christmas 2012
=> #<Date: 2012-12-25>
```

```ruby
# On New Year's Eve, 2011
Timetress.next_christmas
=> #<Date: 2012-12-25>
```

```ruby
# On Christmas Day, 2012
Timetress.previous_christmas
=> #<Date: 2011-12-25>
```

### Public Holidays (Norway & Scotland only)

> A public holiday, national holiday or legal holiday is a holiday generally established by law and is usually a non-working day during the year.
> - Wikipedia

```ruby
Timetress::Norway.public_holidays(2012)
=> [#<Date: 2012-01-01>, #<Date: 2012-04-05>,...]
```

```ruby
Timetress::Scotland.public_holidays(2012)
=> [#<Date: 2012-01-02>, #<Date: 2012-01-03>,...]
```


### Workdays

A workday is a day of the week which is neither a weekend, nor a public holiday.

```
Timetress::Norway.workday? Date.new(2012, 1, 5)
 => true

Timetress::Norway.workday? Date.new(2012, 5, 17)
 => false

Timetress::Scotland.workday? Date.new(2012, 1, 2)
 => false
```

In calculating deadlines and lead time, it's often helpful to count workdays:

```
Timetress::Norway.nth_workday_before 4, Date.new(2012, 10, 25)
 => #<Date: 2012-10-19>

Timetress::Norway.nth_workday_after 1, Date.new(2012, 10, 25)
 => #<Date: 2012-10-26>
```

## Implemented holidays (Scotland)

> **Bank holidays** are holidays when banks and many other businesses are closed for the day. **Public holidays** are holidays which have been observed through custom and practice.
> - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_Kingdom)

### Bank holidays and royal proclamations

In Scotland, bank holidays always extend the weekend. This is done via a royal proclamation.

>Royal proclamation is used to move bank holidays that would otherwise fall on a weekend. In this way, public holidays are not 'lost' in years when they coincide with weekends.
> - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday#Royal_proclamation)

Essentially, if a holiday lands on a weekend, there is a royal proclamation "moving" the day everybody gets off work to the next weekday. I.e. if New Year's Days is on a Sunday, everybody gets Monday off.

## Easter

The cycle of Easter dates repeats after exactly 5,700,000 years, with April 19 being the most common date.

The current implementation simply has a list of 200 years worth of easter.

## Contributing

There are numerous holidays that did not make it onto the list in the first pass, mostly because I don't know about them. I had to look all but New Year's Eve up on Wikipedia.

Please do add missing holidays, as well as modules for other countries.
